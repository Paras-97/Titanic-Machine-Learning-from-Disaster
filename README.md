# Titanic-Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
This repository consists of the code based on the Kaggle competition, "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" 
Major focus is laid on learning visual techniques and data preprocessing. I have made use of conventional ML model and used a Pycaret library. Major purpose of using PyCaret library is to implement it's basic commands and learn it's functioning.
